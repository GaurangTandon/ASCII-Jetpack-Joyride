# Jetpack joyride

This is an amazing implementation of a subset of the Jetpack Joyride game. You will most probably enjoy it.

Special thanks to [zubair's mario console](https://github.com/zubairabid/mario-console/) for giving me ideas on how to go about this project, and to [this website](https://www.sounds-resource.com/mobile/jetpackjoyride/sound/6078/) for providing in-game soundtrack mp3 files.

## Instructions

1. WASD to move, fire bullets with b, activate shield with Space, activate dragon with y and speed up with t.
2. Firebeam is represented by F, and coins by C

**Disclaimer**: This project was only made as a part of IIIT DASS Assingment 1. This project does not endorse the actual game by any means. The developer is NOT liable for ANY and ALL of the waste of your time as a result of playing this addicting implementation.
