# TODO

- add sound to footsteps, background music, coin collection, missile launch (files present in music and sound directories)
- how to add polymorphism?
- improve rendering with multiple parts of the same object having different colors
- fix Game._draw to only repaint pixels that changed
- coins render inside boss
- boss threshold does not come automatically, player has to move
- bullet goes through fire sometimes
- 75 seconds or so before reaching the boss enemy. The game shouldn't finish in just 30 seconds!
- magnet doesn't work!!
- Although private/protected variables can be accessed from stray functions directly, to be in accordance with the concept of OOP, you must use getters and setters to access the same. TAs will check the code for the same.
